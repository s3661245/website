									<h2 class="major">Me and I.T</h2>
									<p>I.T has always been one of my interest ever since I was young, and my dad got a shared computer for our household. Hearing the dial up tone to connect to the internet was always fascinating for me and when it generated a webpage after an extended period was mind blowing for me. I have been programming via python and visual basic as a hobby and for small businesses for four years and my interest in I.T has been ever since I was 13 years old. I’ve built games on game maker just for a little fun and have produced an inventory base program for small business company’s according to their specifications.</p>

I believe that RMIT has the right focus on the industry as it keeps up to date on how it works and connections to the leading businesses internationally. With RMIT’s state of the art facilities I know this uni will be able to provide me with the best materials to be able to gain the practical experience that I need.</p>

I believe that I need a fair amount of professional experience with the world to be able to fully apply my theory or have access to facilities that would allow me to extend my horizons and learn how to apply myself in a professional environment. Focusing on how to improve on my weaknesses and enhance my strengths is something I wish to learn. Application of theory is a very important part I want to learn at RMIT.</p>

									<h2 class="major">What is Speak2Me?</h2>
									<p>My project idea is called Speak2Me which is a mobile application that can translate foreign audio into any other language as an audio output using an AI system. For example, if you’re working in retail and a customer that comes in isn’t proficient in English, the manager will be able to use the application to understand the customer an be able to assist them effectively as they now will be able to understand exactly what the customer wants.

There are over 7000 languages in the world in which 25 make up 50% of this world speaking population.

									<p>This application will be accessible via Google Play and the Apple App Store and it’ll be free to use. In terms of android devices, it will be able to run on android Lollipop and above and with IOS devices, it will be compatible with IOS 7.1 and above. Once an individual will tap on the application a screen will come up showing what language is going to be spoken and what language the user would want it to be translated to. In doing so, the AI system will be connected to the internet to be able to search up specific words and their translation to be able to interpret and translate all words spoken including slang that most translators won’t be able to detect and interpret. As the AI system learns word patterns it’ll gradually become more efficient in detecting phrases and their meaning and string which will increase the overall user’s experience with the program.</p>

									<p>My project will be built on the software Appery to ensure that I can create the application for both Apple and Android devices. It is a cloud based mobile app builder which ensures that connections to the internet and other servers will be possible for me. Appery is an easy to use software which will enhance my learning and make the creation process efficient. I would also need to have access to multiple cloud databases to store language packages as well as one for my AI system to be able to have access to the software, the internet and be able to generate an efficient and effective result from it.</p>

									<h2 class="major">What skills would be required?</h2>
									<p>Speak2Me must have access to the internet via a laptop or computer. The laptop/computer must be able to run Appery hence have at least an 8GB ram for efficiency, 200+ GB of storage and run an i7 intel processor chip to ensure that the software doesn’t lag. It should run Windows 10 which ensures that the software will be compatible with the device used. Since most data will be stored either on the laptop, it’ll be backed up using a hard drive after every change made for language dictionaries and code will be backed up to the Appery account. Software would be able to be installed off the Appery website itself and a laptop or computer will be bought from any JB Hifi store. Knowledge of programming would be required as well as some amount of creativity to create an aesthetic and well-designed app.</p>

									<h2 class="major">What happens if the project is a success?</h2>
									<p>If this project is successful it will be able to connect people from all around the world. It’ll help teacher help students in developing an third-world countries, businesses to be able to provide more specific needs for their clients and help everyone to be able to connect with everyone. Language barriers won’t be too much of a hassle with my app and the best thing that separates my application from all other voice translators is the efficiency from the introduction of an AI. It’s also less in terms of storage space as the AI is stored on a cloud-based server. My project will be able to help millions around the world to unify and unite the world and the people in it.</p>
